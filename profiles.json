      "Aaron's helped me a great deal on my quest to become a good songwriter. He's very knowledgeable and can help with anything from how to structure a song to how to use chords to how to bring out the best in a song I've been working on. He gives lessons and take-home assignments. At the same time, he's patient and friendly, and his sessions are a lot of fun. I feel fortunate to have found him. - Todd, 25 lessons with Aaron",
      "I was hoping to find tutors for music production and Spanish. I did not think I would find one tutor who could do both well, but I was wrong. Aaron is an excellent tutor in both subject, and much more. He is quick to pick up on what I need help with and adapts lessons on the fly to meet my needs. He's also very easy to talk to! - Victoria, 12 lessons with Aaron",
      "Very patient. Learned a lot. Highly skilled. Will use again in the future no doubt. Have zero musical background but Aaron brought themes and topics down to my level. - James, 1 lesson with Aaron"
